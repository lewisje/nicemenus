Creates menubars, popup, context and tear-off menus.

Features a small footprint (under 10K minified), XHTML support, keyboard control and graceful degradation.  Encapsulation ensures that it will not collide with other scripts.  Tested with IE5, IE5.5, IE6, IE7, Firefox 2, Netscape 6.2, Netscape 9, Opera 9 and Safari Beta Windows versions.

Supports custom special effects and includes a stock effects plug-in (5K minified) with several ready-made effects and easing options.  Effects can be used individually or combined.  An application plug-in (3K minified) enables programmatic control of menu items, including disabling, checking (standard or radio group), attaching callbacks and updating captions.  Tear-off menus are also implemented with a plug-in (2K minified.)
